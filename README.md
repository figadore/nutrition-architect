Nutrition Architect
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a concept site for meal planning and nutrition tracking. I never got around to finishing it

Target audience agrees strongly with one of the following
-"I want to make sure I'm eating all my weekly nutrients" 
-"I want to limit a certain nutrient (fat, cholesterol, carbs)" 
-"I want to plan my meals ahead of time so I know how much time I'll be in the kitchen and what I'll need when shopping" 
-"I want to track the shelf life of foods I own" 

Audiences agreeing more with one of the following should go somewhere else
-"I want to track everything I eat/ate on a daily basis"
-"I want to make sure I'm getting the recommended amount of each food group"
